                Vivid Axis has proudly partnered with the American Red Cross to launch a fundraising campaign aimed at supporting those devastated by the recent catastrophic wildfires in California. Thousands of Californians have lost their homes, cherished mementos, and livelihoods as entire neighborhoods were reduced to ash. In the face of this tragedy, the American Red Cross has been a beacon of hope, providing essential services like food, shelter, emotional care, recovery planning, and financial assistance to those in need. With nearly 450 Red Cross responders working tirelessly around the clock, over 680 evacuees found refuge in six shelters as of Thursday morning. Since the fires began, the American Red Cross has distributed over 33,000 meals and snacks, aided by the generosity of their partners and donors. The outpouring of support from the local community has been truly inspiring, with more than 8,000 new volunteers stepping up to assist in relief efforts. Through this partnership, we are honored to contribute to the relief efforts by helping raise funds that will support the victims of the devastating wildfires. By joining forces with the American Red Cross, Vivid Axis is proud to assist in providing vital resources and support to those who have been affected. Your generosity will directly impact those in need, ensuring they receive the care and assistance they deserve as they recover from this tragedy.
